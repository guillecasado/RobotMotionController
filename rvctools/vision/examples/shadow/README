QUICK START
===========

put the m-files in this folder into your MATLAB path
you must have my Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB (MVTB) installed, get it from petercorke.com/vision

>> im = iread('shadow_person.jpg');
>> invariant(im, 2.3);

which will display the original and invariant images in a new figure.

invariant() has many options. To compute the sharpening matrix

>> M = sharpen()

M =

    0.9988   -0.0669   -0.0001
   -0.0497    0.9886   -0.0001
   -0.0043   -0.1346    1.0000

To compute the projection angle

>> esttheta(im)

click several points to enclose the head and shoulders of the person's shadow, then
hit RETURN.
