This folder contains a MATLAB-only SURF implementation by Dirk-Jan Kroon
which is obtained from

http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28300-opensurf-including-image-warp

This is OpenSURF_version1c

There are couple of patches applied, provided here as .patch files, apply them to pristine
downloaded files by

patch OpenSurf.m OpenSurf.patch
patch FastHessian_interpolateExtremum.m FastHessian_interpolateExtremum.patch

the patches modify the default SURF settings, and return the SURF descriptor strength.
